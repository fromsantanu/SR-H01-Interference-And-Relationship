# SR-H01-Interference-And-Relationship

## Hypothesis : 
"Among married couples or those individuals who are in relationships, if they are less interfering with each other, then the strength of the relationship becomes stronger."

## Research Plan
- Define Interference: Develop a scale to measure interference, including items on personal space, decision-making autonomy, and control behaviors.
- Measure Relationship Strength: Use the Relationship Satisfaction Scale (RSS) to measure the strength of relationships.
- Participant Recruitment: Recruit 200 couples through online platforms, community centers, and counseling services.
- Survey Administration: Administer the interference and relationship strength surveys to participants.
- Data Analysis: Perform correlation and regression analysis to test the hypothesis.
- Qualitative Follow-up: Conduct interviews with a subset of couples to gain deeper insights.
- Report Findings: Prepare a comprehensive report and seek publication in a relevant journal.
